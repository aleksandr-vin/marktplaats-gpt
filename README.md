# ChatGPT for conversations in Marktplaats

To keep the conversation with peers and convince them in:

1. buying at the listed price

2. selling with discount


## Setup

```
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install poetry
```

### Install dependencies

Due to tricky authentication process with Marktplaats (using unofficial [*marktplaats-messages*](https://github.com/aleksandr-vin/marktplaats-messages) python client),
python Tk library is needed:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

### Development install

```
poetry install
```


## Configure

Provide following env vars (or place a *.env* file of the structure):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_ORG_ID=...
```

### Marktplaats authentication

Is tricky, you'll need to open https://marktplaats.nl and log in, open Developer Tools > Network tab and right-click on any request to marktplaats.nl (after you log-in),
choose Save as Curl. That will copy full request command (with cookies) to clip buffer.

Run next command to extract cookies and place them in *.env*:

```
python -m marktplaats_messages.cookie_awareness >> .env
```


## Run

### Listing conversations

First you'll need to list recent conversations:

```
marktplaats-gpt --list-conversations
```

That will bring something like:

```
Listing 2 newly-updated conversations (from 0):
{id} [{unreadMessagesCount}] :: {title} :: {otherParticipant_name} :: {itemId}
14s06:4xxxxk3:2klxxxxb0 [0] :: Cannondale Scalpel Lefty 26" L Carbon :: Julia :: m20xxxxxx83
142dw:2xxxxdv:2klxxxxzt [2] :: Cannondale Scalpel Lefty 26" L Carbon :: Mike :: m20xxxxxx83
```

### Loading item data

Next step is to load product data for item-id (mind the last element in every conversations row):

```
marktplaats-gpt --load-item-data m20xxxxxx83 > item.data
```

### Prepare context for ChatGPT

```
cat chat-context item.data > context.txt
```

Here you combine the *chat-context* file and recently created *item.data* files to make a system context for ChatGPT.

### Dry-run the ChatGPT suggestion

Next you can dry-run the conversation, to see what ChatGPT will suggest:

```
marktplaats-gpt --dry-run --conversation 142dw:2xxxxdv:2klxxxxzt --openai-model gpt-4
```

That should give something like:

```
Conversation 142dw:2xxxxdv:2klxxxxzt with Mike has 5 messages:
